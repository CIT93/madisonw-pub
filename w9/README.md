My understanding of the code is that it first all activates through the event listener when we first submit our info. The info is grabbed through the form event listener and is passed to the start function where it sets the values like the carbon footpoint total. The function also passes into the two determining points functions in the cbfpt.js. It also goes into render.js where the text content is created with the submitted information also using the inner html from keeping a certain part from repeating.

The video was very helpful in seeing how the code works in tandem with each other and I understand more of how things are set up with code.

I think we could use the splice's replace feature using similar code to the button delete event listener.

LOCAL STORAGE
-----------------------
Local storage is data that is kept beyond sessions and does not expire. We can use it for keeping track of our or user data and have that data not be volatile. You can implement data to local storage through the devtools console.
